GENEREAL DESCRIPTION This is my first project, i've deleveloped it in a month and a for the final project of programming I from my carreer.We used all we've learned, like lists and dictonaries management,file management, exceptions, Regular expretions,OOP,SQL and some other stuff that you can see in the programm.

PROJECT STATUS the proyect it's actually unfinished an it was just so we can apply and demonstrate all we learned in this last four months. The game counts with a menu, some configuration options and different levels that you can select anytime you want.Game sounds, enemies and some traps are also part of the project. The idea is to get it over and maybe jump in in unreal or unity game development to understand and be more comfortable with a game making tool.

ENVIRONMENT This proyect is being developed on VSC, using pygame library, there are no any other game making tool used.

INSTALLATION In order to instal the game, you have to download the files of the repositores on the same folder(you can find them on the repository). As the files used, are with the relative path of location, you are not required to edit them on the code in order to succesfully run the code.

THIS PROJECT IS ENTIRELY MADE BY MYSELF AND SOME CLASSMATES TIPS, WITH THE HELP OF DIFFERENT DOCUMENTATION AND CLASS INFORMATION PROVIDED AT MY UNIVERSITY OR PYGAME DOCUMENTATION
